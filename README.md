# Condition Tracker

Condition Tracker is a simple webapp for keeping track of player statuses in tabletop roleplaying games such as Pathfinder and D&D. It allows a user to create player cards with some player information on them. Status effects can then be added to the card to be toggled on or off.

### Getting Started

Currently the entire app is exicuted client side, and does not use server reliant features such a cookies, so the index file simply needs to be run with a browser to open the app.

### Prerequisites

Requires an internet connection as jQuery, popper and bootstrap are all accessed remotely.
